Late Binding: In VBScript, objects are often used without explicit declarations. This can lead to runtime errors if the object isn't available or if a method doesn't exist.  Consider the following example where the object 'ExcelApplication' might not be running:

```vbscript
Set objExcel = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  ' Handle error
Else
  ' Use objExcel
End If
```

This code attempts to get a reference to an already running Excel application.  If Excel isn't running, GetObject will fail silently.  Error handling is crucial but often overlooked.

Type Mismatches: VBScript is weakly typed, so type mismatches might not be caught during compilation. This often leads to runtime errors that are difficult to debug.

```vbscript
Dim x, y
x = "10"
y = 5
MsgBox x + y ' Results in string concatenation "105" instead of addition
```

Unexpected Data Types: Functions might return unexpected data types. If not checked, this can cause downstream errors.

```vbscript
Function GetValue(someValue) 
  If IsNumeric(someValue) Then
    GetValue = someValue * 2
  Else
    GetValue = "Not a number"
  End If
End Function

Dim result
result = GetValue(5)
MsgBox TypeName(result)  ' Returns "Double"
result = GetValue("abc")
MsgBox TypeName(result)  ' Returns "String"
MsgBox result + 5 ' Causes a runtime error if this was not handled
```
